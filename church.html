                FOUNDERS DAY SUNRISE SERVICE
            </p>
            <p class = "ReflectionParagraph1">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The Founders Day Sunrise Service, held on August 28, 2024, was a meaningful event that took place early in the morning at our community park. The service lasted about two hours and gathered students, faculty, and community members together to honor the legacy of our founders. The objective was to reflect on the community’s history and inspire ongoing growth and unity. My role in the activity was as a participant, assisting with setting up and engaging in discussions during the ceremony. I also helped facilitate a few of the reflections shared by attendees. Others involved were the event coordinators, who handled the logistics, and guest speakers who shared their thoughts on the founders’ impact.

                Through this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of community values and engagement. Initially, I expected to simply attend and enjoy the ceremony, but I was surprised by how much the event made me reflect on the founders' legacy and its ongoing influence. One moment that stood out was a speech given by a founding member, which deeply moved me. I also met a fellow participant whose perspective on how the founders’ values shaped their personal choices made a lasting impression. Although I struggled with the early timing and felt a bit drowsy, the powerful message of the service helped me stay focused and inspired.

                This experience has broadened my understanding of how history and shared values shape both individual and collective futures. It reinforced the idea that a community built on strong principles can weather challenges and continue to grow. I plan to apply what I’ve learned by staying involved in future community events and contributing to initiatives that promote unity and service. I also see the value of reflecting on the lessons of the past to guide future actions. If I could do the project again, I would suggest starting it a bit later in the day to ensure everyone is more awake and energized.

                Because of this activity, I am more committed to fostering unity and service within my community, recognizing the importance of carrying forward the legacy of those who built it.

                Being part of a fellowship centered around God as a college student provides spiritual growth and a supportive community. On October 2, 2024, the fellowship allowed students to encourage each other, share struggles, and grow in faith through prayer, worship, and studying the Word. The goal was to help students navigate college challenges while living out their faith and serving others. I participated by sharing my experiences and learning from others, while the leaders facilitated the sessions and guided discussions.

                Through this experience, I learned how to live out my faith more practically. Initially, I thought I would simply attend, but I became more engaged in discussions and worship than expected. I was surprised by the openness of the group and how sharing personal struggles strengthened our sense of community. One person’s story of overcoming challenges through faith deeply impacted me, reminding me of the power of prayer. The most satisfying part was the peace I felt afterward, knowing I’m part of a supportive community.

                This experience has broadened my perspective on the importance of faith in facing life’s challenges. It taught me that spiritual growth is about both personal development and helping others. I plan to stay involved in the fellowship and contribute more in the future. I see the benefits of this activity in providing spiritual support and fostering meaningful connections. If I could do it again, I’d be more proactive in leading discussions and encouraging others.

                Because of this activity, I am more committed to living out my faith and supporting others in their journey.

                OPENING DEVOTION
            </p>
            <p class = "ReflectionParagraph3">
                The opening devotion on August 19, 2024, at our college church set a spiritual tone for the day, helping students refocus on God amidst the pressures of academic life. This devotion served as a reminder that our work and interactions are not merely for personal gain but as offerings to God. It provided a moment for spiritual renewal, offering guidance and strength in the face of stress. During this time, I had the opportunity to reflect and give thanks to the Lord for His care and provision during my time at Silliman.

                Through this experience, I learned the importance of pausing to center myself spiritually amidst the busyness of school life. I initially expected the devotion to be a brief break from my routine, but it became a meaningful moment of gratitude and reflection. I was surprised by how much the devotion helped me reconnect with God and gain a sense of peace before facing the day’s challenges. The most satisfying part was the sense of renewal I felt afterward, which gave me the strength to approach my academic responsibilities with a fresh perspective.
                
                This experience reinforced the importance of spiritual practices in maintaining balance and perspective in daily life. I plan to continue participating in devotions and seeking moments of reflection throughout the semester. The benefits of these gatherings are clear, providing a spiritual foundation for the day ahead. If I could do it again, I would encourage more students to actively engage and reflect during these moments.
                
                Because of this activity, I am more committed to starting each day with gratitude and spiritual focus, trusting God to guide me through all my responsibilities.

                The event on October 19, 2024, was a fun and exciting day, as it was the annual "Buglasan" festival. Many booths were set up, offering a variety of foods, and I had the opportunity to explore different houses representing the municipalities of Negros Oriental. Before the festivities began, the day started with an Ecumenical service, and we took the opportunity to attend and listen, which set a meaningful tone for the event.

                Through this experience, I learned the importance of pausing to reflect spiritually even amid celebrations. Initially, I was focused on the excitement of the festival, but I was pleasantly surprised by how the Ecumenical service helped me center myself before diving into the day’s activities. It reminded me that while enjoying life’s festivities, it’s important to stay grounded and spiritually aware. The most satisfying part was the peaceful and reflective start to the day, which allowed me to enjoy the festival with a renewed sense of gratitude.

                This experience showed me that spiritual reflection can enhance my enjoyment of events and provide balance amidst the excitement. I plan to continue attending such services, as they provide a meaningful foundation before engaging in other activities. If I could do it again, I would encourage others to join the service, as it added a valuable dimension to the day.

                Because of this activity, I am more mindful of taking time to reflect spiritually, even in the midst of fun and celebration.

                CARING CIRCLE LESSONS
            </p>
            <p class = "ReflectionParagraph5">
                Bible study on October 16, 2024, has been a deeply enriching experience for me. It’s a time to slow down, reflect, and seek a deeper understanding of God’s Word. As I read through the Scriptures, I not only learn about the historical context but also feel challenged to apply the lessons to my own life. Each verse speaks to different aspects of my journey, whether it’s finding comfort in difficult times or receiving guidance in moments of uncertainty. Thanks to our mentor, my friend and I have been able to grow in our understanding of God and His perspectives.

                Through this experience, I’ve learned the importance of pausing to reflect on the deeper meaning of life and the Scriptures. Initially, I expected to simply learn more about the Bible, but I was surprised by how relevant and personal the lessons were to my own experiences. One verse, in particular, gave me comfort during a challenging time, and it made me realize how God’s Word speaks to us in unique ways. The most satisfying part of Bible study has been feeling more connected to my faith and understanding God’s guidance in my life.
                
                This experience has encouraged me to be more intentional in seeking God’s Word for wisdom and guidance. I plan to continue participating in Bible study, as it has become an important part of my spiritual growth. The benefits of this activity are clear—it provides spiritual nourishment and strengthens my relationship with God. If I could do it again, I would aim to delve even deeper into the Scriptures and explore more ways to apply them to my life.
                
                Because of this activity, I am more committed to seeking spiritual growth through reflection and the study of God’s Word.

                The Academic Convocation on October 14, 2024, was a memorable experience for me. Fortunately, the event was held inside the Luce Auditorium, which was a relief as it was incredibly hot outside. We had to wait in line for a while before the doors opened, but the anticipation didn’t dampen my excitement. I was really looking forward to the event, and once it began, I felt inspired by the speeches and the sense of purpose in the air. It marked the beginning of a new chapter in my academic journey, full of hope and anticipation for the future.

                Through this experience, I was reminded of the hard work and dedication that brought me to this point in my studies. Initially, I expected the ceremony to be formal and routine, but it turned out to be much more impactful. As I listened to the speeches and reflected on the achievements of my peers and mentors, I felt a renewed commitment to my academic goals. The most satisfying part was the feeling of being part of something bigger, knowing that I’m surrounded by individuals who are equally committed to their personal and academic growth.

                This event reinforced the importance of setting goals and striving to achieve them, no matter the challenges. I plan to carry the motivation and sense of purpose from this ceremony throughout my academic journey. The benefits of this event are clear: it serves as a reminder of what we’ve accomplished and the opportunities that await us. If I could do it again, I would encourage more students to reflect on their personal achievements and set new goals for the future.

                Because of this activity, I am more determined to stay focused on my academic goals and pursue them with renewed passion.

The event provided a moment to pause and reflect on my academic journey, reminding me of how much I’ve learned both inside and outside the classroom. With the semester nearing its end, it encouraged me to stay focused and keep pushing forward, even when the challenges seem overwhelming.

Initially, I expected the convocation to be a regular event, but I was surprised by how it prompted me to reflect on my own growth and the progress I’ve made. I was particularly moved by the sense of community during the event, which made me feel supported and reminded me of the shared journey we all are on.

                Attending the fellowship on November 19, 2024, was a truly uplifting experience. It provided a chance to connect with others who share the same faith and values. During our time together, I felt encouraged and supported by the community as we shared our thoughts, prayers, and experiences. The fellowship reminded me that I am not alone on my journey and that we grow stronger through our shared faith. The discussions were insightful, and I left feeling more grounded in my beliefs and motivated to live out those values in my daily life.
