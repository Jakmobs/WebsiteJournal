                On August 13, 2024, we had an NSTP orientation for the freshmen college students. The event aimed to introduce the new students to the National Service Training Program and its purpose, emphasizing the importance of community service and personal development. My role during this orientation was to assist with the activities, answer any questions, and guide the freshmen through the program’s objectives. Other<br/> members of the NSTP team, including facilitators and staff, played an essential role in presenting information and ensuring that the event ran smoothly.

                Through this orientation, I gained a deeper understanding of the impact that community service can have, both on the individual and the community. Initially, I expected it to be just a typical briefing, but I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and interactive the session was. I felt<br/> a renewed sense of purpose as we discussed the importance of giving back to the community and how it ties into our personal growth. One of the most impactful moments for me was seeing the excitement and<br/> eagerness of the freshmen, which reminded me of the value of service in shaping a better society. The most satisfying part was seeing everyone leave with a clearer understanding of their role in the program and the positive change they could create.

                This experience deepened my belief in the power of service and how it can shape our perspectives and actions. I plan to continue being involved in NSTP activities, contributing to<br/> the success of future projects. The benefits of participating in this program are clear—it not only helps in personal development but also strengthens our sense of community. If I could do it again, I would focus on<br/> making the session even more interactive and encouraging more participation from the students.

                Because of this activity, I am more committed to serving my community and helping others grow through service.

                    On August 20, 2024, we attended a workshop seminar on Big Data and IoT, led by a single expert speaker. The seminar introduced us to how Big Data and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming industries. I learned how sensors, for example, can trigger light switches based on motion or environmental changes, demonstrating how IoT can make everyday life smarter and more efficient. The speaker shared practical examples of how these technologies are applied, from smart homes to healthcare systems.

                    Through the seminar, I gained a clearer understanding of how Big Data and IoT work together to improve various sectors. Initially, I was unfamiliar with the scope of these technologies, but I was surprised by the real-world applications and how they can simplify processes. The most exciting part was learning how sensors can automate everyday tasks, like controlling lights or optimizing energy usage. The technical details were a bit challenging, but the examples made them easier to understand.

                    This experience highlighted the growing importance of data and automation in shaping the future. After graduation, I plan to dive deeper into these technologies and explore how they can be applied in real-world projects. If I could do it again, I would focus on gaining more hands-on experience with IoT devices and understanding their integration with Big Data systems.

                    Because of this activity, I am more motivated to explore the potential of IoT and Big Data in shaping our future.

                    On August 21, 2024, my friends and I participated in<br/> Fitness Challenge Day 2, which featured a fun Zumba<br/> session. The event was organized by Trixter, whose<br/> effort made the experience exciting and enjoyable.<br/> Thanks to his energy and enthusiasm, the Zumba<br/> session was lively and motivating, creating a vibrant<br/> atmosphere that encouraged everyone to participate<br/> and have fun.

                    Through this event, I realized how<br/> enjoyable fitness can be when it’s incorporated into<br/> a fun activity like dancing. Initially, I thought it would<br/> be just another workout, but I was pleasantly<br/> surprised by how much fun I had during the Zumba<br/> session. The most satisfying part was feeling<br/> energized and accomplished after dancing, and<br/> I left the event with a positive mindset about staying<br/> active.
                    
                    This experience reminded me of the<br/> importance of finding enjoyable ways to stay fit. I<br/> plan to continue participating in similar fitness activities<br/> and encourage others to try Zumba. The benefits of this<br/> event are clear it promotes physical health while having<br/> fun and bonding with others. If I could do it again, I<br/> would focus on improving my moves and stamina to<br/> fully enjoy the session.

                    On August 21, 2024, we participated in an event called<br/> Book Bingo, which was far from ordinary. Instead of the<br/> usual bingo game, we discussed classic stories like<br/> Harry Potter, Red Riding Hood, and Snow White, and<br/> played mini-games related to these stories. I can’t<br/> remember the last story, but each game was connected<br/> to the themes and characters of the tales, making it a<br/> fun and engaging experience.

                    Through this event, I<br/> realized how much fun learning about stories in an<br/> interactive way can be. Initially, I thought it would just<br/> be a casual bingo game, but I was pleasantly surprised<br/> by how much the mini-games brought the stories to life<br/> and made us think about them in new ways. The most<br/> exciting part was how much fun we had and how it<br/> brought people together. We not only learned about<br/> the stories but also gained new friends, bonding over<br/> the games and shared laughter.

                    This experience<br/> showed me the power of interactive learning and how<br/> games can create strong connections. I plan to<br/> participate in more events like this, where learning is<br/> fun and social. The benefits of this event were clear<br/> it made literature more enjoyable and created lasting<br/> friendships. If I could do it again, I would love to see<br/> even more stories and mini-games added to make it<br/> even more engaging.

                    Because of this activity, I am<br/> more open to participating in fun, social learning<br/>events that bring people together.

The speaker shared valuable insights into new technologies, frameworks, and best practices shaping the future of web development. I actively participated by taking notes and engaging in discussions about how these trends could impact the industry and my future career.

                        Through the seminar, I learned about the growing importance of responsive design, mobile-first development, and progressive web apps. Initially, I wasn’t fully aware of how quickly web technologies are evolving, but I was surprised by how these new tools can improve user experience and optimize web performance. The most exciting part was discovering cutting-edge strategies for building faster, more interactive websites.
                        
                        This experience deepened my understanding of web development and inspired me to explore these trends further.

                On September 7, 2024, we attended an online seminar about the<br/> responsible usage of digital technology. The speaker discussed<br/> important topics such as proper internet etiquette, respecting others<br/> online, and the importance of safeguarding personal information. I<br/> participated by taking notes and reflecting on how these practices<br/> apply to my own online behavior.

                Through the seminar, I learned more<br/> about the ethical responsibilities we all have when using the internet.<br/> Initially, I thought digital etiquette was simply about being polite, but<br/> I was surprised by how deep it goes, involving respecting others'<br/> opinions, privacy, and fostering a positive online environment. The<br/> most valuable takeaway for me was the emphasis on protecting<br/> personal information, especially in the age of data breaches and<br/> online scams.

                This experience made me more conscious of my<br/> online actions and the importance of respecting others in digital<br/> spaces. I plan to implement the speaker’s advice by being more<br/> careful with my personal data and promoting respectful online<br/> communication. If I could do it again, I would like to explore more<br/> about cybersecurity and how to prevent online threats.

                This seminar<br/> has encouraged me to be more mindful of how I use digital technology<br/> and the impact it has on both my privacy and the community.
