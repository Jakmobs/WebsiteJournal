                On August 20, 2024, I attended a sports event organized by the SUSG Sports Committee. I didn’t think I would be able to attend, as I only saw the post<br/> announcing the match five minutes before it started. I assumed I had missed it, but fortunately, I managed to arrive just in time to watch the game.<br/> The event took place at the Cimafranca Ballfield, and the energy in the atmosphere was contagious. Although I wasn’t playing, I enjoyed being a spectator and watching the competition unfold. The match itself was exciting, and the players showed great teamwork and dedication. I didn’t know anyone personally<br/> who was participating, but I admired how committed they were to their game, and it made the experience enjoyable for me as a viewer. What stood out<br/> most to me was how smoothly the event ran, and the positive, competitive spirit everyone brought to the field.
                The most satisfying part of the experience was witnessing the excitement of the match and the sense of camaraderie among the participants, even though I wasn’t directly involved. It made me realize<br/> how events like these foster a sense of community, and how important it is to show up and support activities that bring people together. From this experience, I learned the value of staying open to unexpected opportunities. Initially, I thought I would miss the event, but by arriving last-minute, I was able to enjoy the match and the atmosphere. This taught me that sometimes it’s not about having everything perfectly planned, but about making the most of what’s available. If I could have been more involved, I would have liked to volunteer or assist in some way, but I was still happy to be part of the experience by simply attending.
                Reflecting<br/> on the event, I now realize the importance of being adaptable and making the most of opportunities that arise, even if they come at the last minute. In the future, I plan to stay open to similar experiences and avoid assuming that I’ve missed out if I haven’t planned ahead. This event showed me that showing up, even unexpectedly, can still be a rewarding experience. If I had the chance to attend another event like this, I would try to prepare earlier, so I could participate more actively. Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of being present and taking part in events, even when they arise suddenly.

            On August 22, 2024, I attended the CSS Esports event organized by the Confederated Student Council (CSS). I was excited about the event because I have a strong interest in esports, and the event gave me the opportunity to watch skilled players compete. The event was held at the university’s sports hall, and the atmosphere was lively as many people, like myself, were there to enjoy the matches. Although I wasn’t participating in the event, I was a spectator, cheering on the players. The event was well-organized, and everything ran smoothly, making it an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. I didn't know any of the players personally, but I appreciated their skill and teamwork, which made the event even more thrilling.

            I didn’t expect to meet new people at the event, but I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to strike<br/> up conversations with other spectators. Everyone shared a common interest in gaming, which made it easy to connect and make new friends. The most enjoyable part of the experience was seeing how the event brought together people with similar passions. The matches were intense, and the level of competition was impressive. What surprised me the most was the strong sense of community among the spectators. Everyone seemed excited, and the energy in the venue was contagious. The event made me realize how important it is to be part of a community that shares your interests and how such experiences can lead to new friendships and connections.

            This experience has made me more aware of how valuable it is to engage in activities and events that align with my personal interests. It showed me that even if I’m not actively participating, attending such events can still be rewarding, especially when I connect with others who share similar passions. Looking ahead, I’d like to continue attending esports events and get more involved, perhaps by volunteering or supporting future activities. If I could attend another event like this, I would plan ahead to make sure I could be more actively engaged, possibly contributing to the organization or taking part in the event. Because of this activity, I am more motivated to stay involved in the esports community and look for more opportunities to participate in similar events in the future.

            <p class = "maxzeal_reflection">
                On August 31, 2024, I participated in a martial arts training session, accompanied by my friend Bon. Martial arts is something I’ve always been interested in, so when the opportunity arose to join, I was excited to take part. The training was held at a local dojo which is the Maxzeal Martial Arts Gym, where the instructor<br/> led us through various techniques. The community there was welcoming, and it was easy to get along with other participants, even though I was new. My role in the activity was as a student, learning and practicing martial arts techniques, while Bon and other participants were also engaged in the same training session. The instructor was experienced and offered clear guidance throughout the session, helping us to improve our skills step by step.

                I learned several new<br/> techniques during the training, which was both challenging and rewarding. Initially, I expected the session to be a lot more difficult, but I found that the instructor paced the class well, allowing everyone, regardless of experience level, to participate comfortably. I was surprised by how well I could follow along. The most surprising part was how supportive the community was. Even though I was a newcomer, I felt encouraged by others, and it made the experience much more enjoyable. The most satisfying part of the training was mastering a few basic moves, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment. However, I did find some of the physical movements difficult, and it required a lot of focus and effort. This experience made me appreciate the dedication and discipline that martial arts require. The session was a good way for me to express my values of personal growth and resilience, as it pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me<br/> the importance of perseverance.

                This experience has made me more aware of how martial arts can help with both physical fitness and mental discipline. It<br/> showed me that I can push myself to learn new things, even if they seem difficult at first. I plan to continue attending the sessions, as they offer both a physical challenge and an opportunity to learn something I’m passionate about. I believe the benefits of martial arts go beyond just physical fitness; it’s also about<br/> building discipline and focus. If I could do this activity again, I would focus on improving my techniques and perhaps ask for more personalized feedback from the instructor to make faster progress. Because of this activity, I am more determined to pursue martial arts and incorporate its values of discipline and perseverance into other aspects of my life.

            On September 3, 2024, I attended a basketball tournament in Dauin, which was part of an interbarangay competition. The event took place during the local fiesta in Dauin, adding an extra layer of excitement to the day. I was interested in attending the tournament to see the competition and experience the vibrant atmosphere of the fiesta. I went with my friends, who were familiar with the area. They not only accompanied me to the basketball games but also took the time to show me around Dauin, pointing out some of the best spots in the town. My role in the activity was as a spectator, enjoying the games and learning more about the town's culture and traditions. My friends, who had local knowledge, were key in making sure I experienced everything Dauin had to offer.

            During the event, I enjoyed watching the basketball competition, which was filled with energy and strong performances from the players. I didn’t expect to see such high-level play at a local tournament, and it was a pleasant surprise. The basketball games were exciting, and the energy from the crowd made it even more enjoyable. I also appreciated the chance to experience the local culture, as the fiesta added a festive vibe to the event. The most surprising part of the day was how welcoming and lively the town felt, especially with the fiesta celebrations happening at the same time. The games were great, but exploring the town with my friends and learning about Dauin’s local culture was equally enjoyable. The experience allowed me to see how sports and local traditions can bring people together. The atmosphere of the fiesta and the community spirit it created left a lasting impression on me.

            This experience has made me more appreciative of local events and how they connect people through both sports and culture. It showed me how much you can learn from a place by not just attending an event but also exploring the area and understanding its traditions. Moving forward, I would love to visit Dauin again during a fiesta or other local celebrations to further explore and immerse myself in its culture. If I could attend a similar event again, I would plan to stay longer and participate in more activities to get an even deeper experience of the town. Because of this activity, I am more interested in visiting other local events and appreciating the rich cultural experiences they offer.

                SILLIMAN SWIM TEAM TRYOUTS
            </h1>
            <p class = "swim_reflection">
                On September 25, 2024, my friends and I attended a swimming tryout to support our friend, who was trying out for the team. We were there to cheer him on, offering our encouragement as he went through the tryout process. The event was held at the university’s swimming pool, where a few other students were also trying out for the team. My role in this activity was as a spectator, watching our friend perform and supporting him throughout the process. My friends and I were<br/> all there together, with our primary goal being to show our support for him during this important moment. While we were focused on our friend, I couldn’t help but notice how much I enjoyed watching the swimming tryouts and how exciting the competition was.

                As I watched the tryouts, I grew more interested in swimming. Initially, I hadn’t thought much about swimming as a sport, but seeing the skill and technique involved made me want to try it for myself. I was surprised by how intense the competition was and how much focus and practice it required. What stood out to me was how disciplined the swimmers were and the effort they put into their performance. It was inspiring to see my friend compete, and it made me realize how much I wanted to try swimming myself, even if just for the<br/> experience. The most satisfying part of the day was being able to support my friend, but I also felt a sense of personal growth as I began to think about my own goals in swimming.

                Reflecting on this experience, I realized that trying new things and supporting others can lead to unexpected personal interests. Watching my friend try out for the swimming team sparked an interest in the sport that I hadn’t considered before. I now plan to join the swimming competition at the upcoming intramurals, not necessarily to compete at a high level, but to gain experience and push myself out of my comfort zone. I believe the experience will help me<br/> grow, not only as an athlete but also in terms of resilience and discipline. If I could do this again, I would focus more on preparing myself for the competition and<br/> try to improve my swimming skills before the event. Because of this activity, I am more motivated to try swimming and look forward to participating in the<br/> intramurals for the first time.

            On September 7, 2024, I attended a softball competition held by the Amateur Softball Association of the Philippines (ASAPHIL) and the Dumaguete Baseball Softball Association. The event took place in the morning, and I decided to go alone since the venue was located near my area, Daro, Dumaguete City. I was interested in watching the competition because I enjoy sports and had never seen a softball game in person before. My role in this activity was as a spectator, observing the teams as they competed. Since I didn’t know any of the players personally, I was there purely to enjoy the event and learn more about the sport.

            As I watched the game, I became more intrigued by softball, especially by how strategic and fast-paced the game was. I had never fully appreciated the skill involved, but seeing the athletes’ coordination and focus on the field made me realize how much practice and teamwork go into the sport. I was pleasantly surprised by how intense and engaging the competition was, and it sparked an interest in trying the sport myself in the future. The most satisfying part of the experience was witnessing the teamwork and athleticism of the players, which made me respect the sport more. Although I was watching alone, the supportive atmosphere among the spectators made the event feel more lively and enjoyable.
            
            Reflecting on this experience, I realized how much I can learn from attending local sports events and how they can spark new interests. I had gone with no particular expectations, but the competition made me more curious about the sport of softball and how it’s played at a higher level. In the future, I would like to try playing softball, not necessarily at a competitive level, but to experience the sport firsthand. If I could do this activity again, I would bring a friend along to share the experience with and perhaps get more involved by asking the players or coaches about their techniques. Because of this activity, I am now more interested in exploring different sports and attending future competitions to broaden my understanding of various athletic activities.

                On September 7, 2024, in the afternoon, I returned to the same event where I had watched the softball competition earlier in the day, but this time I was curious about a different sport being played roundnet. It was the first time I had ever heard of roundnet, so I wanted to learn more about how it worked. The roundnet<br/> game was scheduled for the afternoon, so I decided to come back and watch the match. This time, I was there alone, just like in the morning, but I was excited to observe a new and unfamiliar sport. The match was held in the same area, and I stood as a spectator, trying to understand the rules and the dynamics<br/> of roundnet.

                As I watched the roundnet game, I became more intrigued by how the sport worked. I was surprised by how fast-paced and competitive it was, and how much skill was required to play it well. The game seemed simple at first teams hit the ball onto a net, trying to prevent the opposing team from returning it<br/>  but the strategies and movements were complex, and it took real coordination and teamwork. I didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did, and I was fascinated by how the players were so focused and agile. The most surprising part was how quickly I became engaged in the match, despite not knowing much about the<br/> sport beforehand. The game’s intensity and the enthusiasm of the players made it exciting to watch.

                Reflecting on this experience, I learned that trying new<br/> things or observing unfamiliar activities can open my eyes to new interests. Initially, I was curious but uncertain about roundnet, but after watching the game, I found myself eager to learn more and perhaps try it out myself. This experience has shown me that stepping out of my comfort zone and exploring different<br/> sports can lead to new experiences and interests. If I could do this again, I would make sure to learn the rules before watching, so I could understand the game even better. Because of this activity, I am now more open to exploring sports I haven’t considered before, and I’m excited to try roundnet and other new activities<br/> in the future.

            On September 8, 2024, in the afternoon, I attended a futsal competition held at Foundation University. I went with my friend Reynielle, who is an alumnus of the university. Since he knew the campus well, he gave me a tour of the university before we watched the game. My role in the activity was as a spectator, enjoying the competition and exploring the campus. Reynielle played a significant role as a guide, sharing his experiences at the university while also being my companion throughout the day.

            Watching the futsal competition was an exciting experience. I had seen futsal before, but I didn’t expect the matches to be so fast-paced and intense. The players demonstrated a high level of skill and teamwork, which made the game even more thrilling to watch. I was surprised by how quickly the players could change direction and how they maintained such precision in their movements. The atmosphere was also lively, with a lot of people cheering for their respective teams. Reynielle’s stories about his time at Foundation University also gave me a deeper appreciation for the place. The most enjoyable part was both watching the competition and hearing Reynielle’s perspective on his college experiences.
            
            Reflecting on this experience, I realized that<br/> attending events like this helps me appreciate sports in a new way and also allows me to explore different places and cultures. This experience also deepened my connection with Reynielle, as I learned more<br/> about his university life. In the future, I would like to attend more sports events to further explore different types of sports and improve my knowledge of them. If I could do it again, I would try to interact more with<br/> the players or event organizers to learn about the strategies involved in futsal. Because of this activity, I am now more interested in futsal and would love to attend future competitions to continue learning and enjoying the sport.
